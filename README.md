- 👋 Hi, I’m @giadaleone99
- 👀 I’m interested in studying how plastic pollution on Scottish beaches is temporally and spatially distributed, and what factors can affect these distributions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use R, GitHub and just starting with version control and collaborative coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small and simple projects in R for beginners.
- 📫 You can reach me at giada.leone99@outlook.com
